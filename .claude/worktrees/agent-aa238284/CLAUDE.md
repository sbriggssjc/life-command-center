# Claude Code / Cowork Instructions — Life Command Center

> **CRITICAL: Read .github/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md before modifying any files in /api/.**

## Vercel Hobby Plan Constraint

HARD LIMIT: 12 serverless functions max (12 .js files in /api/).
Currently at 9 functions (Phase 4b freed 3 slots via edge migration).
data-proxy, daily-briefing, diagnostics absorbed into admin.js + Supabase Edge Functions.

## Rules

0. LCC_API_KEY auth is production-ready (Phase 6b). Frontend auth.js auto-injects X-LCC-Key via global fetch interceptor. To enforce: set LCC_API_KEY + LCC_ENV=production in Vercel.
1. NEVER create new .js files directly in /api/
2. Add new endpoints as sub-routes (use ?action= or ?_route= query param patterns)
3. New utility/handler code goes in /api/_shared/ or /api/_handlers/
4. After ANY /api/ change, verify: `ls api/*.js | wc -l` must be <= 12
5. Update vercel.json rewrites when adding new sub-routes
6. Use descriptive Round-numbered commit messages, never generic "GPT changes"
7. See .github/AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md for full architecture and routing patterns

## Architecture Quick Reference

- LCC orchestrates, domain Supabase backends execute domain logic
- Contacts + Entities consolidated into entity-hub.js (routes to _handlers/)
- Bridge + Workflows consolidated into operations.js
- Intake functions consolidated into intake.js
- admin.js: workspaces, members, flags, connectors, diagnostics (config/diag/treasury), edge proxies (data-query, daily-briefing)
- Supabase Edge Functions: data-query (gov/dia PostgREST proxy), daily-briefing (snapshot orchestration) on LCC Opps project
- pg_cron (Phase 5): 6 scheduled jobs on LCC Opps — refresh_work_counts (5min), nightly preassemble/cross-domain-match, daily briefing, weekly report, history cleanup
- `lcc_cron_post()` helper reads API key from Supabase Vault, POSTs via pg_net to Vercel or Edge endpoints
- All rewrites defined in vercel.json — order matters (specific before catch-all)

## Dialysis `v_sales_comps` — `rent` semantics

As of `supabase/migrations/20260416120000_v_sales_comps_projected_rent.sql`,
the dialysis `v_sales_comps` view returns rent *projected to CURRENT_DATE*,
not Year-1 base rent. Consumers need to know:

- `rent` — current rent, escalated from the anchor (property `anchor_rent` when
  `anchor_rent_source IN ('lease_confirmed','om_confirmed')`, else
  `leases.annual_rent`) through `properties.lease_bump_pct` /
  `lease_bump_interval_mo`. Projection math lives in
  `api/_shared/rent-projection.js` (`projectRentAtDate`) and is mirrored in
  SQL by the `public.dia_project_rent_at_date()` helper.
- `base_rent` — the Y1 `leases.annual_rent` figure (what `rent` used to be).
  Render it as a secondary value when you need to show the unescalated rent.
- `rent_per_sf` — projected rent / `leases.leased_area`, NOT the Y1 figure.

Downstream writers that still need Y1 rent should pull `base_rent`. The
current dialysis.js Sales Comps loader (`loadDiaSalesCompsFromTxns`) bypasses
the view and assembles rows from `sales_transactions` + `leases` directly, so
it continues to show Y1 rent until switched over to the view.
